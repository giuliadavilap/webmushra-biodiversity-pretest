      content: Welcome to the Soundscape Biodiversity Level Pre-Test.<br/>In this experiment, you will listen audio field recordings with varying biodiversity levels.<br/> Biodiversity refers to the variety of living species—such as birds, insects, and other animals—within a natural environment. A soundscape with higher biodiversity will feature a richer and more varied mix of natural sounds.<br/>Your task is to compare each recording to a reference sound and identify which one is most similar in its level of biodiversity.<br/>For optimal results, please use headphones, adjust the volume with the first stimulus, and ensure you are in a quiet environment.

      content: You will hear a reference audio recording followed by some test stimuli.<br/><br/>Please rate the perceived level of biodiversity of each stimulus compared to the reference on a scale from 0 to 100.<br/><br/>100 = Identical to reference (same amount of species) <br/><br/>0 = Very different from reference (totally different amount of species) <br/><br/>Use the entire scale and trust your perception
